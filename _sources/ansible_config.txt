   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.


Utilizing Ansible with FlexSwitch 
=================================

Utilizing the JSON file method, it is possible to utilize automation tools like Ansible to manage FlexSwitch configurations.  First we will go through how to manipulate configuration utilizing a JSON configuration file manually, then
we will demonstrate how this can be done utilizing Ansible. 
 

Configuration via JSON File
***************************
In addition to configuring FlexSwitch via API calls – it is also possible to supply a configuration file formatted in JSON.

For, example this JSON file will configure these parameters from the previous examples:

3 Vlans are created:
	- Vlan 100, ports 1-10 with IP address 10.10.100.1/24
	- Vlan 200, ports 11,12 with IP address 10.10.101.1/24
	- Vlan 300, ports 13-15, and 17 with IP address 10.10.102.1/24
	- Speed is set to 1G for port 1
	
Example desiredConfig.json:

	::

		{
			"Vlan": [
				{
					"UntagIntfList": "1-10",
					"IntfList": "",
					"VlanId": 100
				},
				{
					"UntagIntfList": "11,12",
					"IntfList": "",
					"VlanId": 200
				},
				{
					"UntagIntfList": "13-15,17",
					"IntfList": "",
					"VlanId": 300
				}
			],
			"IPv4Intf": [
				{
					"IntfRef": "vlan100",
					"IpAddr": "10.10.100.1/24"
				},
				{
					"IntfRef": "vlan200",
					"IpAddr": "10.10.101.1/24"
				},
				{
					"IntfRef": "vlan300",
					"IpAddr": "10.10.102.1/24"
				}
			],
			"Port": [
					{
					"PortNum": 1,
					"Speed": 1000
				}
			]
		}

This JSON file is declarative and not order-dependent – all configurations are ingested at once and executed in the order required.


Configuration files are parsed and executed using the “monitor.py” python app:


	1) Add JSON configuration to desiredConfig.json (creating the file, if necessary):
		::
			
			$ vi /opt/flexswitch/desiredConfig.json
 
	2) Apply the configuration using monitor.py in the /opt/flexswitch/apps/cfgmon directory:
		::
		
			$ cd /opt/flexswitch/apps/cfgmon

			$ python monitor.py --applyConfig=True

			Namespace(applyConfig=True, cfgDir='/opt/flexswitch/', ip='localhost', poll=None, port='8080', saveConfig=True)
			System Is ready
			Configuration is saved to /opt/flexswitch//runningConfig.json
			Updating object Port
			Creating Object Vlan
			Creating Object Vlan
			Creating Object Vlan
			Creating Object IPv4Intf
			Creating Object IPv4Intf
			Creating Object IPv4Intf

Now that the configuration is applied, the operational state can be verified:

Ansible Integration
*******************

Prerequisites:

Prior to utilizing Ansible to manage FlexSwitch, a working Ansible environment needs to be built.

	1) Follow the Operating System appropriate instructions to install Ansible on the desired host:
		::
		
			http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html

			For the purposes of this guide, these steps were performed on an Ubuntu Server running 14.04:

			$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
			$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
			$ sudo apt-get update
			$ sudo apt-get install ansible

	2) Generate an SSH key for Ansible to use for managing devices:
		::
			$ ssh-keygen

			For the purposes of this guide a passphrase is not used and the key is stored in the default location: /home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

	3) This generated SSH key needs to be added to the root user of the device, enabling SSH management by Ansible:
		::
		
			On the device to be managed by Ansible:

			$ sudo mkdir -p /root/.ssh/
			$ sudo vi /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

			Add the contents of id_rsa.pub from the user on the device running Ansible to this authorized_keys file.  The id_rsa.pub contents should be one line and follow this format:

			ssh-rsa <snip> ansible@ansible-server.snaproute.com

	4) Add target host to /etc/ansible/hosts:
		::
		
			$ sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts

			Add hosts as either IP or resolvable hostname, one on each line.  The /etc/ansible/hosts inventory file can be simply a list of hosts or it can be more complex and define groups – as outlined in the example.

			For this example, here is the contents of the Ansible inventory file:

			$ cat /etc/ansible/hosts
			10.1.10.43

	5) The ssh key can be tested by issuing a “ping” from Ansible:
		::

			$ ansible -u root -m ping all

			10.1.10.43 | SUCCESS => {
				"changed": false, 
				"ping": "pong"
			}

			The above shows a successful ping response using the remote user of root, as that is the user that houses the SSH key on the target system.

**Managing FlexSwitch:**

Now that Ansible is installed and working with the device – it is possible to manage FlexSwitch configurations.

This example will deploy the JSON configuration filed referenced previously.

	1) Confirm target host is listed in the Ansible inventory file:
		::
		
			$ cat /etc/ansible/hosts
			10.1.10.43

	2) Create directories for playbooks, templates, and host_vars:
		::
		
			$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/ansible/playbooks
			$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/ansible/templates
			$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/ansible/host_vars

	3) Convert the previously deployed JSON configuration into a template:

		Ansible uses the Jinja2 Python templating language for building variable-based configuration files.

		Jinja2 uses this syntax for specifying a variable in a template file:
		::
		
			{{ variable_name }}


		Using this method of templating – the JSON configuration from the previous example can be templatized:
		::

			{
				"Vlan": [
					{
						"UntagIntfList": "{{ vlan_1_port_range }}",
						"IntfList": "",
						"VlanId": {{ vlan_1 }}
					},
					{
						"UntagIntfList": "{{ vlan_2_port_range }}",
						"IntfList": "",
						"VlanId": {{ vlan_2 }}
					},
					{
						"UntagIntfList": "{{ vlan_3_port_range }}",
						"IntfList": "",
						"VlanId": {{ vlan_3 }}
					}
				],
				"IPv4Intf": [
					{
						"IntfRef": "vlan{{ vlan_1 }}",
						"IpAddr": "{{ vlan_1_ip }}/{{ vlan_cidr_bits }}"
					},
					{
						"IntfRef": "vlan{{ vlan_2 }}",
						"IpAddr": "{{ vlan_2_ip }}/{{ vlan_cidr_bits }}"
					},
					{
						"IntfRef": "vlan{{ vlan_3 }}",
						"IpAddr": "{{ vlan_3_ip }}/{{ vlan_cidr_bits }}"
					}
				],
				"Port": [
						{
						"PortNum": 1,
						"Speed": {{ port_1_speed }}
					}
				]
			}

		Save the above template in this location:
		::
		
			/etc/ansible/templates/flexswitch_example.j2

	4) Assign values to the variables used in the template:

		Ansible has a flexible structure for assigning variables to hosts and groups, allowing for a hierarchy to be built.  


		For this example, variables will be defined for this specific target host:
		::
		
			vlan_1: 100
			vlan_2: 200
			vlan_3: 300
			vlan_1_port_range: 1-10
			vlan_2_port_range: 11,12
			vlan_3_port_range: 13-15,17
			vlan_1_ip: 10.10.100.1
			vlan_2_ip: 10.10.101.1
			vlan_3_ip: 10.10.102.1
			vlan_cidr_bits: 24
			port_1_speed: 1000

		Save the above lines to this file:
		::
		
			/etc/ansible/host_vars/10.1.10.43


	5) Build Ansible playbook:

		With the template and host_vars files in place, all that is required is an Ansible playbook that builds the FlexSwitch config file and deploys it to the target device.

		This playbook will do the following:
			- Use apt-get to install FlexSwitch (if it is not already installed)
			- Ensure that FlexSwitch is currently running
			- Build the desiredConfig.json file based on the flexswitch_example.j2 template
			- Whenever there is a change to desiredConfig.json (i.e. a variable or the template is updated) – the monitory.py application is run to apply the new configuration

		Example Ansible playbook:
		::
			
			---
			- hosts: all
			  remote_user: root 
			  tasks:
			  - name: ensure flexswitch is installed
				apt:
				  name: flexswitch=0.0.92
				  state: present
				  update_cache: yes
				  force: yes
			  - name: ensure flexswitch is running
				service:
				  name: flexswitch
				  state: started
			  - name: configure flexswitch
				template:
				  src: /etc/ansible/templates/flexswitch_example.j2
				  dest: /opt/flexswitch/desiredConfig.json
				  force: yes
				notify:
				- load flexswitch config
			  handlers:
				- name: load flexswitch config
				  command: chdir=/opt/flexswitch/apps/cfgmon python monitor.py --applyConfig=True 

	The above assumes that apt-get has been configured to point to a repo that contains the FlexSwitch package (in this case version 0.0.92) or that FlexSwitch has been manually installed.  

	This playbook should be saved as:
	::
	
		/etc/ansible/playbooks/flexswitch.yml


	6)	Run playbook to configure FlexSwitch:

		Using the ansible-playbook command – the previously configured playbook can be run to apply FlexSwitch configs to the target host:
		::
		
			$ ansible-playbook flexswitch.yml 

			PLAY [all] *********************************************************************

			TASK [setup] *******************************************************************
			ok: [10.1.10.43]

			TASK [ensure flexswitch is installed] ******************************************
			ok: [10.1.10.43]

			TASK [ensure flexswitch is running] ********************************************
			changed: [10.1.10.43]

			TASK [configure flexswitch] ****************************************************
			changed: [10.1.10.43]

			RUNNING HANDLER [load flexswitch config] ***************************************
			changed: [10.1.10.43]

			PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
			10.1.10.43                 : ok=5    changed=3    unreachable=0    failed=0   

		This output shows that the playbook was successfully applied to 10.1.10.43, indicating which tasks caused changes to be applied.  Since this is the first run of the playbook and the target device had no configurations – the result is “changed” for each of the configuration tasks.


		A subsequent run – where neither the variables or the template is updated results in a playbook run where nothing is changed:
		::
		
			$ ansible-playbook flexswitch.yml 

			PLAY [all] *********************************************************************

			TASK [setup] *******************************************************************
			ok: [10.1.10.43]

			TASK [ensure flexswitch is installed] ******************************************
			ok: [10.1.10.43]

			TASK [ensure flexswitch is running] ********************************************
			changed: [10.1.10.43]

			TASK [configure flexswitch] ****************************************************
			ok: [10.1.10.43]

			PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
			10.1.10.43                 : ok=4    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0   

			Note: The “ensure flexswitch is running” task may show “changed” even if FlexSwitch is already running (it will not reload FlexSwitch).



		Now that the configuration is applied via Ansible, the operational state can be verified:
