FlexSwitch Config Models
========================
FlexSwitch configuration APIs are defined as model objects. Code generation tools take the model as input and produce code that ConfigMgr invokes to send configuration to back-end servers and store in DB.
A model object can be configuration, state or action type. Few objects can be both configuration and state types.

Create, Update, and Delete operations can be performed on configuration objects. These APIs send configurations to back-end server for proessing and stores in DB for persistency.
Get operation can be performed on state objects. These APIs request state object(s) from back-end server and responds back.
Exec operation can be performed on action objects. These APIs are send a command to back-end server to perform a certain action, such as clean stats on port, etc.

Model objects can be defined as go struct or in yang file. This document describes how to define a model object in go struct.
There are various tags used to identify nature of the object or field in the object.

::

  ACCESS: "w"          ---- Object type - "w" means config, "r" means state and "x" means action
  MULTIPLICITY: "*"    ---- How many instances of this object can exist. "*" means multiple and "1" means singleton
  ACCELERATED: "true"  ---- If the object can be configured in asynchronous mode.
  USESTATEDB: "true"   ---- if true then this state object is stored in DB.
  AUTOCREATE: "true"   ---- If true then this object will be automatically created with default values when FlexSwitch come up.
  SNAPROUTE: "KEY"     ---- Identifies if this field is a key in this object. There can be more than one keys.
  DESCRIPTION: "<str>" ---- Description of the field.
  DEFAULT: <"value>"   ---- Default value of this field.
  LEN: "<length>"      ---- If the field is of type string then length of the string allowed.
  SELCTION: "<a>/<b>"  ---- List of possible values allowed for this field.
  MIN: "<value>"       ---- If the field is of type integer then minimum value allowed.
  MAX: "<value>"       ---- If the field is of type integer then maximum value allowed.
  RANGE: "<a>-<b>"     ---- If the field is of type integer then range of values allowed in the range.
